## Project Overview

This project provides a Chrome extension that allows users to:

- Search for an English word or phrase and see the corresponding ASL sign video(s).
- Handle synonyms, plurals, and place names (cities, states, countries).
- Suggest close matches if an exact match is not found.
- Open videos in fullscreen via a new tab.

The project also includes scripts and data for managing the ASL video dataset and generating the synonym mappings.

## Architecture

**Main Components:**

- **Chrome Extension (`extension/`)**
  - `popup.html`, `popup.js`, `styles.css`: The user interface and logic for the popup.
  - `search.js`: Core search and synonym logic.
  - `glossary.json`: Maps glosses (ASL words/phrases) to video filenames.
  - `synonyms.json`: Maps English words/phrases/abbreviations to glosses (supports multiple meanings).
  - `asl_videos/`: Directory of ASL sign videos, organized by first letter and gloss.
  - `contextMenu/background.js`: Adds right-click context menu support.

- **Data and Scripts**
  - `batch_download_transcode/`, `extract_gloss_prefix_postfix/`: Python scripts for managing and processing the video dataset.
  - `dataset/`: Contains CSVs and other data for the ASL dataset.

## Prerequisites for Beginners

If you are new to programming or web development, you should learn:

- **Basic JavaScript**: Variables, functions, objects, arrays, and ES6+ syntax.
- **HTML & CSS**: How web pages are structured and styled.
- **JSON**: Data format for configuration and data files.
- **Chrome Extensions**: How browser extensions work, especially manifest v3.
- **Basic Python** (optional): For running dataset management scripts.

## Key Files and Documentation

### `extension/popup.js`

- **Purpose:** Handles the popup UI, user input, and search results.
- **Key Functions:**
  - `performSearch(word)`: Main search logic, handles synonyms, partial matches, and video rendering.
  - `renderVideos(videoPaths, label)`: Renders video elements and a button to open in fullscreen (new tab).
  - `renderSuggestions(suggestions, label, onClick)`: Renders clickable suggestions for close matches.
  - `clearResults()`: Clears previous search results from the UI.

### `extension/search.js`

- **Purpose:** Core search and synonym logic.
- **Key Class:**
  - `GlossarySearcher`: Handles loading data, searching for videos, handling synonyms, and fuzzy matching.
    - `initialize()`: Loads glossary and synonym data.
    - `findVideos(word)`: Returns video paths for a word or its synonyms.
    - `findPartialMatches(word)`: Returns close/fuzzy matches.
    - `getCanonicalWord(word)`: Returns the canonical gloss(es) for a word.
    - `getSynonyms(word)`: Returns all synonyms for a word.
    - Helper methods: `normalizeWord`, `getAllSynonymVariants`, `getPossibleGlossKeys`, `searchGlossaryForWord`, `binarySearch`, `normalizeForFuzzy`.

### `extension/glossary.json`

- **Purpose:** Maps glosses (ASL words/phrases) to arrays of video filenames.

### `extension/synonyms.json`

- **Purpose:** Maps English words/phrases/abbreviations to glosses (can be multiple for ambiguous words).

### `extension/asl_videos/`

- **Purpose:** Contains all ASL sign videos, organized by first letter and gloss.

### `extension/contextMenu/background.js`

- **Purpose:** Adds right-click context menu support for searching highlighted words.

### `batch_download_transcode/`, `extract_gloss_prefix_postfix/`

## How to Use

1. **Install the Extension:**
   - Load the `extension/` folder as an unpacked extension in Chrome.

2. **Search for a Word:**
   - Type or highlight a word/phrase and use the popup to search for its ASL sign.

3. **View Results:**
   - If found, videos will be shown. Use the "Open Fullscreen" button to view in a new tab.
